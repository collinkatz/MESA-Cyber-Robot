## Description
In this project the Python is used to program a virtual robot to navigate through a series of virtual mazes executing a mission. The the robot must collect packets in a pre-defined order, disable viruses in locked boxes, and collect clues to crack the mazesâ€™secret passphrases while avoiding bugs. This mission will challenge the path finding aspect of the solution developed. 


## Objectives
- collect packets in order
- avoid bugs
- solve the viruses
- get through the maze as quickly as possible
    - **? I think the maze auto exits after all packet are collected ? **
- avoid already visited cells as often as possible
- use as few sensor calls as possible
- avoid wall collisions
- no hard code
